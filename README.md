# Gender diversity in the series industry

In a previous post, I studied the gender diversity in the film industry, by focusing on some key **behind-the-camera roles** and measuring the evolution of their gender diversity in the last decade. The conclusion was not great: women are under-represented, especially in the most important roles of directors and writers, while these key roles determine the way women are portrayed in front of the camera. 

I was curious about the series industry too: **as series are a more recent area than movies, they might be more open to women?** I decided to have a look.

In this post, as in the film industry one, the behind-the-camera roles I studied were the following: **directors**, **writers**, **producers**, **sound teams**, **music teams**, **art teams**, **makeup teams** and **costume teams**.

Here again, all the data I used was gathered from the **IMDb website**: I studied the [`100 Most Popular TV Shows`](https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter?sort=rk,asc&mode=simple&page=1) (according to the IMDb rating).
