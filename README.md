# Gender diversity in the series industry

Introduction
------------

In a previous post, I studied the gender diversity in the film industry,
by focusing on some key **behind-the-camera roles** and measuring the
evolution of their gender diversity in the last decade. The conclusion
was not great: women are under-represented, especially in the most
important roles of directors and writers, while these key roles
determine the way women are portrayed in front of the camera.

I was curious about the series industry too: **as series are a more
recent area than movies, they might be more open to women?** I decided
to have a look.

In this post, as in the film industry one, the behind-the-camera roles I
studied were the following: **directors**, **writers**, **producers**,
**sound teams**, **music teams**, **art teams**, **makeup teams** and
**costume teams**.

The whole code to reproduce the following results is available on
[`GitHub`](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/Gender-diversity-series-industry).

Data frame creation - Web scraping
----------------------------------

Here again, all the data I used was gathered from the **IMDb website**:
I went through the
[`100 Most Popular TV Shows`](https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter?sort=rk,asc&mode=simple&page=1)
(according to the IMDb rating), and gathered some useful information
about these 100 series: I built a data frame which contains the titles
of these series, their years of release and their IMDb episode links -
the link where we can find all the episodes of a series.

    # IMDb 100 most popular TV shows ------------------------------

    url <- "https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter?sort=us,desc&mode=simple&page=1"
    page <- read_html(url)

    serie_nodes <- html_nodes(page, '.titleColumn') %>%
      as_list()

    # Series details
    serie_name <- c()
    serie_link <- c()
    serie_year <- c()
    for (i in seq_along(serie_nodes)){
      serie_name <- c(serie_name, serie_nodes[[i]]$a[[1]])
      serie_link <- c(serie_link, attr(serie_nodes[[i]]$a, "href"))
      serie_year <- c(serie_year, serie_nodes[[i]]$span[[1]])
    }
    serie_link <- paste0("http://www.imdb.com",serie_link)
    serie_year <- gsub("[()]", "", serie_year)
    serie_episodelist <- sapply(strsplit(serie_link, split='?', fixed=TRUE),
                                function(x) (x[1])) %>%
      paste0("episodes?ref_=tt_eps_yr_mr")


    # Create dataframe ----------------------------------------------
    top_series <- data.frame(serie_name, serie_year, serie_episodelist, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


    # serie_year was the date of 1rst release but we needed the years of release for all the episodes
    # I did not manage to gather this information by doing some web scraping.
    # I added it manually as it is available on the IMDb episodes links (column serie_episodelist)

    top_series[20:30, ]

The series\_year column often contains several years. For example, for
the series called "This is us", it means that episodes have been
released in 2016, 2017 and 2018. This column will allow me to split the
episodes by year of release, and then visualise the gender diversity of
the crew for each year.

List creation - Web scraping
----------------------------

At this stage, I just had some global information on the 100 series. The
next step was to go through the IMDb links gathered in the column
"series\_episodelist" of my `top_series` data frame, which give me
access to all the series episodes split by year of release. I did some
**web scraping** on these links and built a list which gathered:

-   the names of the 100 most popular TV shows

-   for each series, the different years of release

-   for each year, the names of the episodes which have been released

-   for each episode, the names of the people whose job was included in
    one of the categories I listed above (directors, writers, ...,
    costume teams)

        series_list[[serie_name]] <- episodes_list_peryear
      } 
    }

Let's have a look at the information gathered in `series_list`. Here are
some of the names I collected:

    ## - Black Mirror, 2011
    ##  Episode: The National Anthem 
    ##  Director: Otto Bathurst

    ## - Black Mirror, 2017
    ##  Episode: Black Museum 
    ##  Director: Colm McCarthy

    ## - Game of Thrones, 2011
    ##  Episode: Winter Is Coming 
    ##  Music team: Ramin Djawadi, Evyen Klean, David Klotz, Robin Whittaker, Michael K. Bauer, Brandon Campbell, Stephen Coleman, Janet Lopez, Julie Pearce, Joe Rubel, Bobby Tahouri

    ## - Game of Thrones, 2017
    ##  Episode: Dragonstone 
    ##  Music team: Ramin Djawadi, Omer Benyamin, Evyen Klean, David Klotz, William Marriott, Douglas Parker, Stephen Coleman

What we can see is that for the same series the crew changes depending
on the episode we consider.

Gender determination
--------------------

Now that I had all the names gathered in the `series_list`, I needed to
determine their gender. I used the same package as in my previous post
on the film industry: **GenderizeR**, which "uses genderize.io API to
predict gender from first names". More details on this package and the
reasons why I decided to use it are available in my previous post.

With this R package, I was able to determine for each episode the number
of males and females in each category of jobs:

-   the number of male directors,

-   the number of female directors,

-   the number of male producers,

-   the number of female producers,

-   ...,

-   the number of male in costume team,

-   the number of female in costume team.

Here is the code I wrote:

    ### Genderize our lists of names

    # for each serie
    for (s in seq_along(series_list) ){  
      print(names(series_list[s])) # print serie name
      
      # for each year
      for (y in seq_along(series_list[[s]])){ 
        print(names(series_list[[s]][y])) # print serie year
        
        # for each episode
        for (i in seq_along(series_list[[s]][[y]])){ 
          print(names(series_list[[s]][[y]][i])) # print serie episode
          
          # Genderize directors -----------------------------------------------------
          directors <- series_list[[s]][[y]][[i]]$directors
          
          if (directors == ""){
            directors_gender <- list()
            directors_gender$male <- 0
            directors_gender$female <- 0
            series_list[[s]][[y]][[i]]$directors_gender <- directors_gender
          }
          
          else{
            # Split the firstnames and the lastnames
            # Keep the firstnames
            directors <- strsplit(directors, " ")
            l <- c()
            for (j in seq_along(directors)){
              l <- c(l, directors[[j]][1])
            }
            
            directors <- l
            serie_directors_male <- 0
            serie_directors_female <- 0
            
            # Genderize every firstname and count the number of males and females 
            for (p in seq_along(directors)){
              directors_gender <- genderizeAPI(x = directors[p], apikey = "233b284134ae754d9fc56717fec4164e")
              gender <- directors_gender$response$gender
              if (length(gender)>0 && gender == "male"){
                serie_directors_male <- serie_directors_male + 1
              }
              if (length(gender)>0 && gender == "female"){
                serie_directors_female <- serie_directors_female + 1
              }
            }
            
            # Put the number of males and females in series_list
            directors_gender <- list()
            directors_gender$male <- serie_directors_male
            directors_gender$female <- serie_directors_female
            series_list[[s]][[y]][[i]]$directors_gender <- directors_gender
          }  
          
          # Same code for the 7 other categories -----------------------------------
          
          } 
        }
      }
    }

Here are some examples of numbers of male and female I collected:

    ## Black Mirror, 2011
    ##  Episode: The National Anthem 
    ##  Number of male directors: 1 
    ##  Number of female directors: 0 
    ## 

    ## Black Mirror, 2017
    ##  Episode: Black Museum 
    ##  Number of male directors: 1 
    ##  Number of female directors: 0 
    ## 

    ## Game of Thrones, 2011
    ##  Episode: Winter Is Coming 
    ##  Number of male in music team: 8 
    ##  Number of female in music team: 3 
    ## 

    ## Game of Thrones, 2017
    ##  Episode: Dragonstone 
    ##  Number of male in music team: 7 
    ##  Number of female in music team: 0 
    ## 

Percentages calculation
-----------------------

With these numbers gathered in my list, I then calculated the
percentages of women in each job category, for each year between 2007
and 2018. I gathered these figures in a data frame called `percentages`:

    ##    year directors  writers producers     sound    music      art   makeup
    ## 1  2018  22.69693 25.06514  27.87217 12.247212 23.25581 36.93275 73.10795

Gender diversity in 2017: series industry VS film industry
----------------------------------------------------------

Based on this data frame, I created some bar plots to visualise the
gender diversity of each job category for each year. Here is the code I
wrote to get the bar plot for 2017, which compares the series industry
to the film industry.

    ### Barplot 2017

    # Data manipulation -------------------------------------------------------------

    # Import our movies dataset
    percentages_movies <- read.csv("percentages_movies.csv") 
    percentages_movies <- percentages_movies[ , -1]

    # Change column names for movie and serie dataframes
    colnames(percentages_movies) <- c("year", "directors", "writers", "producers", "sound", "music", "art", "makeup", "costume")
    colnames(percentages) <- c("year", "directors", "writers", "producers", "sound", "music", "art", "makeup", "costume")

    # From wide to long dataframes
    percentages_movies_long <- percentages_movies %>%
      gather(key = category, value = percentage, -year)
    percentages_long <- percentages %>%
      gather(key = category, value = percentage, -year)

    # Add a column to these dataframes: movie or film ?
    percentages_movies_long$industry <- rep("Film industry", 88)
    percentages_long$industry <- rep("Series industry", 96)

    # Combine these 2 long dataframes
    percentages_movies_series <- bind_rows(percentages_long, percentages_movies_long)

    # Filter with year=2017
    percentages_movies_series_2017 <- percentages_movies_series %>%
      filter(year == 2017)


    # Data visualisation -------------------------------------------------------------

    percentages_movies_series_2017$percentage <- as.numeric(format(percentages_movies_series_2017$percentage, 
                                                            digits = 2))

    bar_2017 <- ggplot(percentages_movies_series_2017, aes(x = category,
                                                           y = percentage,
                                                           group = category,
                                                           fill = category)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      facet_wrap(~industry) +
      coord_flip() + # Horizontal bar plot
      geom_text(aes(label = percentage), hjust=-0.1, size=3) +
      theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
            axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
            axis.text.y=element_blank(),
            axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
            axis.title.y=element_blank(),
            axis.title.x=element_text(size = 15),
            strip.text.x = element_text(size = 15, face="bold"),
            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, face="bold"),
            legend.title=element_blank(), # center the title
            legend.text=element_text(size=15)) + 
      labs(title = paste("Percentages of women in", input$variable),
           x = "",
           y = "Percentages") +
      guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) + # reverse the order of the legend
      scale_fill_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Spectral")) # palette used to fill the bars and legend boxs

I have built a simple shiny app which gives access to the bar plots for
each year between 2007 and 2017.

Let's analyse the graph of the year 2017.

If we only focus on series figures, we see that sound teams show the
most limited women occupation, with less than 11%. It is followed by the
**role of director with 20.5%.** Then, we can see that **between 25% and
30% of the roles of writers, producers, music teams and art teams are
taken by women**.

Thus, women are still under-represented in the series industry. However,
even if series figures show little gender diversity in the above job
categories, they are better than the film industry ones, especially for
the key roles of **directors, writors and producers**, which are
respectively **5.7, 3 and 1.2 times higher for the series industry than
for the film one.**

The last thing to notice is that as in the film industry, the series
industry graph shows a representativeness gap between the above roles
and the jobs of **make-up artists and costume designers, among which
more than 70% of the roles are taken by women.**

Gender diversity from 2007 until 2017: series industry VS film industry
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's have a look to the evolution of the gender diversity in these two
industries in the last decade.

    ### Evolution plot

    # year as date
    percentages_movies_series_ymd <- percentages_movies_series %>%
      subset(year != 2018)
    percentages_movies_series_ymd$year <- ymd(percentages_movies_series_ymd$year, truncated = 2L) 

    # Data visualisation
    evolution <- ggplot(percentages_movies_series_ymd, aes(x = year,
                                                           y = percentage,
                                                           group = category,
                                                           colour = category)) +
      geom_line(size = 2) +
      facet_wrap(~industry) +
      theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # center the title
      scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
      scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Set1")) +
      labs(title = "Percentages of women from 2007 to 2017\n Film industry VS serie industry",
           x = "",
           y = "Percentages")

![](serie_industry_blog_post_files/figure-markdown_strict/evolution_show-1.png)

The first thing I noticed is that for both the film and series
industries, **the representativeness gap between the roles of make-up
artists and costume designers and the other ones has not decreased in a
flagrant way since 2007**.

The fact that the roles of directors, writers and producers are more
open to women in the series industry than in the film one is easy to
visualise with this graph, and we can see that it has been the case at
least since 2007 (and probably before). Besides, **since 2007 the series
industry has been more diversified in terms of gender for all the
categories I studied, except for the sound roles**.

I also noticed that **since 2010/2011, in the series industry, almost
all the categories tend to be more diversified in terms of gender**. The
only exceptions are the roles of producers (percentages are generally
decreasing a bit since 2007), sound teams (no improvement has been
achieved since 2010) and costume teams (the trend has been positive only
since 2013). Apart from that, **there is a positive trend for the series
industry, which is not the case for the film industry**.

This trend is significant for the some roles: **writers, music teams,
art teams and make-up teams percentages in the series industry have
increased by 5 to 10% in the last decade**. But if we look at the role
of **directors**, the percentage of women have also increased by 5%
since 2011, but **the percentage reached in 2017 is substantially the
same as the one reached in 2007, just as for the film industry**. Let's
hope that the trend seen since 2011 for directors will continue.

Conclusion
----------

This study has definitely shown that **the series industry is more
diversified in terms of gender than the film industry, especially for
the key roles of directors and writers**.

However even if the series percentages are better than the film ones,
**women are still under-represented in the series industry** as the same
regrettable analysis has been echoed: the only jobs which seem open to
women are the stereotyped female jobs of make-up artists and costume
designers. In all the other categories, the percentages of women in the
series industry never reach more than 30%.

But **contrary to the film industry, the series one is actually evolving
in the right direction**: since 2011, a positive trend has been
happening for, inter alia, directors and writers. This evolution is
encouraging for the future and suggests that powerful female characters,
such as Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones, are coming on TV
screens.
